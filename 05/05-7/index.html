				As we all know, it’s easy for marketers to brag about how great their product or service is. Writing
				compelling copy, shooting enticing photos, or even producing glamorous videos are all tactics we use to
				draw attention to our brands. While all of these strategies can be successful, there really is no better
				way to gain trust and prove the validity of your brand like customer testimonials.

				ZenDesk’s testimonial page is beautifully laid out AND functional, with a silent customer video playing
				on loop to serve as the banner, a menu to filter testimonials by location, company size, industry, and
				use case, and lastly thumbnails linking to the full customer stories for a variety of big-name brands.
				This is a clean and concise way to showcase their happy customers.
